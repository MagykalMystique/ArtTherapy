# ArtTherapy.py
A simple doodling program using python's turtle module

This Art therapy program was my final project for my intro to computer science class
It has two turtles, one is a free-draw that works like a pen, and the other
moves via the arrow keys. The second turtle(the one that moves with arrow keys) also can  draw
some special patterns and shapes
There are 21 colors to choose from for either turtle, This part took A VERY LONG TIME to set up
so I really really hope you're happy with it XD.
There is also an option to erase everything and start over.
You'll want to maximize the turtle window in order to use
the program properly. Otherwise, you won't be able to see your drawing very well, and
the color buttons will be outside your window of vision.
The program prints a set of instructions for how to use a program when you run it.
